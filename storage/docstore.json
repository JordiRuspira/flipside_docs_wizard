We'll walk you through how to:\n\n1. Query blockchain data\n2. Create a visualization\n3. Present your data\n\nDune has many more features, but these are the basics you'll need to get started. If you're looking for more advanced guides, check out the [Analytics Guidelines](analytics_guidelines.md) and [Data Tables](data-tables/index.md) sections.\n\n**Prerequisites:**   \n- You'll need to have a Dune account to follow along. If you don't have one, you can [sign up here](https://dune.com/auth/register).  \n- We also recommend you have a basic understanding of SQL and Blockchain concepts.\n\n### 1. Query blockchain data\n\nTo query for blockchain data on Dune you'll need to:\n\n1. Create a new query\n2. Write some SQL\n3. Run the query\n4. Name and save the query\n\n```sql\n--Query to get Ethereum's unique daily active users and passive users  in 2023\n\nSELECT  \n--truncate time to day\ndate_trunc('day', block_time) AS time,\n-- count distinct addresses that sent a transactions\nCOUNT(distinct \"from\") AS users,\n-- count distinct addresses that received a transaction\nCOUNT(distinct \"to\") AS receiving_addresses\nFROM ethereum.transactions\nWHERE block_time > DATE '2023-01-01'\nGROUP BY 1\n```\n\n**[Direct link to query here.](https://dune.com/queries/2335378)**  \n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: calc(66.66666666666666% + 41px); height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://demo.arcade.software/gT2ctqjvwIuX5xUXPx5S?embed\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;color-scheme: light;\" title=\"Dashboards\"></iframe></div>\n\n\n\n### 2. Create a visualization\n\nTo create a visualization you'll need to:\n\n1. Create a new visualization\n2. Select the type of visualization you want to create\n3. Choose the data source for the x and y axis\n4. adjust the visualization settings\n\nIn our example below, we'll create a line chart to visualize the number of unique daily active users and passive users on Ethereum in 2023. Additionally, we format the axis label and tick label to `0a`to make the numbers more readable.\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: calc(66.66666666666666% + 41px); height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://demo.arcade.software/nNxDjw8vBmp34u3aNU0R?embed\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;color-scheme: light;\" title=\"Dashboards\"></iframe></div>\n\n\n### 3. Present your data\n\nTo present your data you'll need to:\n\n1. Create a new dashboard\n2. Add a visualization to the dashboard\n3. Adjust the layout of the dashboard\n4. Name and save the dashboard\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: calc(66.66666666666666% + 41px); height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://demo.arcade.software/xTAXmlo0nCL0FOn38hW9?embed\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;", "doc_id": "835ee994-1c9b-4f7c-8eec-5019abaafae4", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ceb2372001215d71fcbad1d952b19615112c17759a5c1208aa554981246c6915", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3329, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "92d874ce-fe2b-47b5-b50c-92326d123818", "3": "6d93f9c3-21e2-479f-bb3d-059bba8dc1d0"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "6d93f9c3-21e2-479f-bb3d-059bba8dc1d0": {"__data__": {"text": "allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;color-scheme: light;\" title=\"Creating a dashboard\"></iframe></div>\n\n\n### Recap\n\n**Congratulations, you've just queried blockchain data, created a visualization, and presented your data on Dune!**\n\nYou can now share your dashboard with the world.\n\nWe'll take care of updating this dashboard whenever somebody looks at it, so you don't have to worry about keeping it up to date.\n\n### Next steps\n\nCheck out these resources to learn more about Dune:\n\n- [Dune Official Getting Started Video Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cctFmR828&list=PLK3b5d4iK10ext4v-GBySekaA8-GP8quD&index=1) to learn how the data flows and how to navigate the Dune app to create queries, visualizations, and dashboards. \n\n- [Weekly Web3 SQL problems](https://daodatadesign.notion.site/Web3-SQL-Weekly-0bababb5e59a412bb73594c512db8cc1) to learn wizard tips and tricks in byte-sized bits.
